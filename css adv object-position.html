<!-- The CSS object-position property is used to specify how an <img> or
<video> should be positioned within its container. -->
<!-- Using the object-position Property
Let's say that the part of the image that is shown, is not positioned as we want. To position the image, we will use the object-position property.
Here we will use the object-position property to position the image so that the great old building is in center: -->
<head>
    <style>
        img {
            width: 200px;
            height: 300px;
            object-fit: cover;
            object-position: 50% 80%;
        }
    </style>
</head>
