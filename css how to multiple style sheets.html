  <!-- Cascading Order
"What style will be used when there is more than one style specified for an HTML element?

All the styles in a page will "cascade" into a new "virtual" style sheet by the following rules, where number one has the highest priority:

1. Inline style (inside an HTML element)
2. External and internal style sheets (in the head section)
3. Browser default" From 3Wschools on Casade Order. -->
  <h1>This combo style</h1>
  <p>The style of this document is a combination of an external stylesheet, and internal style</p>
