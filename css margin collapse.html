Top and bottom margins of elements are sometimes collapsed into a single margin that is equal to the largest of the two margins.

<!-- This about collapse margins. And how it works. -->
    <p>In this example the h1 element has a bottom margin of 90px and the h2 element has a top margin of 80px. So, the
        vertical margin between h1 and h2 should have been 170px (90px + 80px). However, due to margin collapse, the
        actual margin ends up being 90px.</p>
