<!-- What are Pseudo-Elements?
A CSS pseudo-element is used to style specified parts of an element.

For example, it can be used to:

Style the first letter, or line, of an element
Insert content before, or after, the content of an element -->

    <style>
        /* This makes the first line the color and font selected */
        p::first-line {
            color: crimson;
            font-variant: small-caps;

        }

        /* This makes the first letter the the color and font selected */
        p::first-letter {
            color: goldenrod;
            font-size: xx-large;
        }

        /* Makes something first letter of class ID. */
        p.intro::first-letter {
            color: navy;
            font-size: 200%;
        }

        /* Combing on line and on first letter. */
        p.combo::first-letter {
            color: orange;
            font-size: xx-large;
        }

        p.combo::first-line {
            color: darkblue;
            font-variant: small-caps;
        }

        /* Inserting Content before heading. */
        h1::before {
            content: url(Unlimitedpow.jpg);
        }

        /* Inserting Content after heading. */
        h1::after {
            content: url(Unlimitedpow.jpg);
        }

        The following example styles the markers of list items: */
        ::marker {
            color: purple;
            font-size: 22px;

        /* The ::selection pseudo-element matches the portion of an element that is selected by a user.
        The following CSS properties can be applied to ::selection: color, background, cursor, and outline.
