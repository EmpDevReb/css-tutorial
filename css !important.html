<!-- What is !important?

The !important rule in CSS is used to add more importance to a property/value than normal.
In fact, if you use the !important rule, it will override ALL previous styling rules for that specific property on that element! -->

    <style>
        #myid {
            background-color: navy;
        }

        /* We can over ride !important with another important */
        .myclass {
            background-color: grey !important;
        }

        p {
            background-color: crimson !important;
        }

        /* To "force" all buttons to have the same look, no matter what, 
        we can add the !important rule to the properties of the butto */

            background-color: #8c8c8c !important;

<!-- All three paragraphs will get a red background color, 
    even though the ID selector and the class selector have a higher specificity. 
    The !important rule overrides the background-color property in both cases. -->

<!-- Important About !important
The only way to override an !important rule is to include another 
!important rule on a declaration with the same (or higher) specificity in the source code - and here the problem starts! 
This makes the CSS code confusing and the debugging will be hard, especially if you have a large style sheet -->

<!-- Recomended not to do this. -->
