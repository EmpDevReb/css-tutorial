<!-- What is Specificity?
If there are two or more CSS rules that point to the same element, the selector with the highest specificity value will "win", and its style declaration will be applied to that HTML element.
Think of specificity as a score/rank that determines which style declaration is ultimately applied to an element. -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
    <style>
        /* This is an even higher priotity selector */
        #demo {color: gold;}
        /* But now we have test selector */
        /* This is because the class selector is given higher priority */
        .test {color: navy;}
        /* We have made p crimson */
        p {
            color: crimson;
        }
    </style>
</head>

<body>
    <!-- Text will be navy blue. But the new selector now will make it gold. But the in-line style will overide all(not Recomended). -->
    <p id="demo" class="test" style="color: pink;">Hello World!</p>

</body>

<!-- Specificity Hierarchy
Every CSS selector has its place in the specificity hierarchy.

There are four categories which define the specificity level of a selector:

Inline styles - Example: <h1 style="color: pink;">
IDs - Example: #navbar
Classes, pseudo-classes, attribute selectors - Example: .test, :hover, [href]
Elements and pseudo-elements - Example: h1, ::before -->
