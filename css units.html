        Many CSS properties take "length" values, such as width, margin, padding, font-size, etc.
        Length is a number followed by a length unit, such as 10px, 2em, etc. 
        Imo Px probably is best to use since it's standard across all devices to a degree.*/

<!-- There more options on how to used units but key is to remember the absolute length units are fixed and a length expressed in any of these will appear as exactly that size.
    However Relative length units specify a length relative to another length property. Relative length units scale better between different rendering mediums.
