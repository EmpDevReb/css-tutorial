<!-- The CSS object-fit Property
The CSS object-fit property is used to specify how an <img> or <video> should be resized to fit its container.
This property tells the content to fill the container in a variety of ways; such as "preserve that aspect ratio" or "stretch up and take up as much space as possible". -->

<!-- Here is where the object-fit property comes in. The object-fit property can take one of the following values:

fill - This is default. The image is resized to fill the given dimension. If necessary, the image will be stretched or squished to fit
contain - The image keeps its aspect ratio, but is resized to fit within the given dimension
cover - The image keeps its aspect ratio and fills the given dimension. The image will be clipped to fit
none - The image is not resized
scale-down - the image is scaled down to the smallest version of none or contain -->
