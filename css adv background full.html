        /* Full Size Background Image
        Now we want to have a background image on a website that covers the entire browser window at all times.

        The requirements are as follows:

        Fill the entire page with the image (no white space)
        Scale image as needed
        Center image on page
        Do not cause scrollbars
        The following example shows how to do it; Use the <html> element (the <html> element is always at least the height of the browser window). Then set a fixed and centered background on it. Then adjust its size with the background-size property: */

        html {
            background: url(Top\ Gun\ Waifu.jpg) no-repeat center fixed;
            background-size: cover;
        }

        body {
            color: rgb(255, 255, 255, 0.572);
        }
    </style>
</head>

<body>

    <h1>Full Page Background Image</h1>
