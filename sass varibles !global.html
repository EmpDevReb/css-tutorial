<!-- Using Sass !global
The default behavior for variable scope can be overridden by using the !global switch.
!global indicates that a variable is global, which means that it is accessible on all levels.
Look at the following example (same as above; but with !global added) -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/sass varibles !global.css">

<body>

    <h1>Goldrodsssss</h1>

    <p>This is deaths yellow</p>

</body>

</html>
