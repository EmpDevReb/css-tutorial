<!-- CSS Multiple Backgrounds

CSS allows you to add multiple background images for an element, through the background-image property.
The different background images are separated by commas, and the images are stacked on top of each other, where the first image is closest to the viewer.
The following example has two background images, the first image is a flower (aligned to the bottom and right) and the second image is a paper background (aligned to the top-left corner) -->

<head>
    <style>
        #example1 {
            background-image: url(Top\ Gun\ Waifu.jpg), url(TOP\ GUNS.jpg);
            background-position: right bottom, left top;
            background-repeat: no-repeat, repeat;
            padding: 15px;
        }

        /* A short cut background.  */
        #example2 {
            background: url(TopGunCrusie.jpg) right bottom no-repeat, url(TOP\ GUNS.jpg) left top repeat;
            padding: 15px;
        }

        /* Background The CSS background-size property allows you to specify the size of background images.

        The size can be specified in lengths, percentages, or by using one of the two keywords: contain or cover.
        The following example resizes a background image to much smaller than the original image (using pixels): */
        #example3 {
            border: 1px solid rgb(71, 3, 3);
            background: url(TOP\ GUNS.jpg);
            background-size: 100px 80px;
            background-repeat: no-repeat;
            padding: 15px;
        }

        #example4 {
            border: 1px solid rgb(43, 72, 135);
            background: url(TopGunCrusie.jpg);
            background-repeat: no-repeat;
            padding: 15px;
        }

        /* The two other possible values for background-size are contain and cover.

        The contain keyword scales the background image to be as large as possible (but both its width and its height must fit inside the content area). As such, depending on the proportions of the background image and the background positioning area, there may be some areas of the background which are not covered by the background image.
        The cover keyword scales the background image so that the content area is completely covered by the background image (both its width and height are equal to or exceed the content area). As such, some parts of the background image may not be visible in the background positioning area.
        The following example illustrates the use of contain and cover: */
        .div1 {
            border: 1px solid crimson;
            height: 120px;
            width: 150px;
            background: url(TOP\ GUNS.jpg);
            background-repeat: no-repeat;
            background-size: contain;
        }

        .div2 {
            border: 1px solid navy;
            height: 120px;
            width: 150px;
            background: url(Top\ Gun\ Waifu.jpg);
            background-repeat: no-repeat;
            background-size: cover;
        }

        .div3 {
            border: 1px solid blueviolet;
            height: 120px;
            width: 150px;
            background: url(TopGunCrusie.jpg);
            background-repeat: no-repeat;
        }

        /* The background-size property also accepts multiple values for background size (using a comma-separated list), when working with multiple backgrounds.
        The following example has three background images specified, with different background-size value for each image: */
        #example5 {
            background: url(TOP\ GUNS.jpg) left top no-repeat, url(TopGunCrusie.jpg) right bottom no-repeat, url(Top\ Gun\ Waifu.jpg) left top repeat;
            padding: 15px;
            background-size: 50px, 130px, auto;
        }

        /* CSS background-origin Property
        The CSS background-origin property specifies where the background image is positioned.

        The property takes three different values:

        border-box - the background image starts from the upper left corner of the border
        padding-box - (default) the background image starts from the upper left corner of the padding edge
        content-box - the background image starts from the upper left corner of the content
        The following example illustrates the background-origin property: */
        #example6 {
            border: 10px solid navy;
            padding: 35px;
            background: url(Top\ Gun\ Waifu.jpg);
            background-repeat: no-repeat;
        }

        #example7 {
            border: 10px solid orange;
            padding: 35px;
            background: url(Top\ Gun\ Waifu.jpg);
            background-repeat: no-repeat;
            background-origin: border-box;
        }

        #example8 {
            border: 10px solid purple;
            padding: 35px;
            background: url(Top\ Gun\ Waifu.jpg);
            background-repeat: no-repeat;
            background-origin: content-box;
        }

        /* Can also do CSS background-clip Property
        The CSS background-clip property specifies the painting area of the background.

        The property takes three different values:

        border-box - (default) the background is painted to the outside edge of the border
        padding-box - the background is painted to the outside edge of the padding
        content-box - the background is painted within the content box
        The following example illustrates the background-clip property: */
        #example9 {
            border: 10px dotted black;
            padding: 35px;
            background: green;
        }

        #example10 {
            border: 10px dotted black;
