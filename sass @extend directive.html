<!-- Sass @extend Directive
The @extend directive lets you share a set of CSS properties from one selector to another.
The @extend directive is useful if you have almost identically styled elements that only differ in some small
details.
The following Sass example first creates a basic style for buttons (this style will be used for most buttons).
Then, we create one style for a "Report" button and one style for a "Submit" button. Both "Report" and "Submit"
button inherit all the CSS properties
from the .button-basic class, through the @extend directive. In addition, they have their own colors defined -->
