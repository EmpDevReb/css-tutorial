// Sass Partials
// By default, Sass transpiles all the .scss files directly. However, when you want to import a file, you do not need the file to be transpiled directly.
// Sass has a mechanism for this: If you start the filename with an underscore, Sass will not transpile it. Files named this way are called partials in Sass.
// So, a partial Sass file is named with a leading underscore
