// Sass @extend Directive
// The @extend directive lets you share a set of CSS properties from one selector to another.
// The @extend directive is useful if you have almost identically styled elements that only differ in some small details.
// The following Sass example first creates a basic style for buttons (this style will be used for most buttons). 
// Then, we create one style for a "Report" button and one style for a "Submit" button. Both "Report" and "Submit" button inherit all the CSS properties 
// from the .button-basic class, through the @extend directive. In addition, they have their own colors defined
.button-basic {
    border: none;
    padding: 15px 30px;
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 16px;
    cursor: pointer;
}

.button-report {
    @extend .button-basic;
    background-color: crimson;
}

.button-submit {
    @extend .button-basic;
    background-color: goldenrod;
    color: white;
